Source code of project BPMN-Gen

The Synthetic Models can be generated by running the main function of SyntheticGraph

SyntheticGraph		-----	generate BPMN models
GraphCollectionProperty	-----	get properties from a given BPMN model collection
SyntheticFragment	-----	generate fragments before generateing BPMN models
Pattern4MultiNodes	-----	record join and split patterns
XML			-----	read BPMN models from .bpmn files and write BPMN models into .bpmn files

Other packages define basic structures like process graphs.

22 BPMN models used in our experiments are in the models/BPMN folder.
2200 generated BPMN models are in the models/syntheticBPMN folder.
